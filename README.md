# _Ping-Pong_

#### _Code review #3 for Epicodus night class, March 10, 2018_

#### By _**Michael Fritz**_

## Description

_This website is a showcase of the skills learned in the third portion of Epicodus's Part Time Programming course. Meant to show understanding of javascript arrays and looping_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _With the use of jQuery and Bootstrap CDN links, you shouldn't need to download another files outside of the repository. User should input a numnber, and ping-pong will count up to that number, though it will display numbers divisible by 3 as ping, numbers divisible by 5 as pong, and numbers divisible by 15 as ping-pong_

## Behavior Driven Development 

| Behavior: our program should handle:                | Input Example | Output Example                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| A counted display of a users number input           | 10            | [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] |
| When a number is divisible by 3, display ping       | 3             | [ 1, 2, ping]                    |
| When a number is divisible by 5, display pong       | 5             | [ 1, 2, 3, 4, pong]              |
| When a number is divisible by 15, display ping-pong | 15            | [ 1, 2, 3, ...13, 14, ping-pong] |
